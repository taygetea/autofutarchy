# Autofutarchy Governance Document

## Overview

This prediction market system governs itself through futarchy - a form of governance where we "vote on values, bet on beliefs." The system uses its own prediction markets to make decisions about its future development.

## Core Principle

> "The codebase should evolve in whatever direction prediction markets believe will maximize our chosen metrics."

## Governance Metrics

The system optimizes for these measurable values:

1. **Code Quality Score** (0-100)
   - Test coverage percentage
   - Linting compliance 
   - Cyclomatic complexity
   - Documentation completeness

2. **System Performance** (0-100)
   - API response time
   - Market resolution accuracy
   - Uptime percentage
   - Database query efficiency

3. **Market Health** (0-100)
   - Total trading volume
   - Number of active markets
   - Liquidity depth
   - Price discovery efficiency

4. **AI Consensus** (0-100)
   - Agreement between different LLM traders
   - Prediction accuracy vs real outcomes
   - Reasoning quality scores

## Decision Process

### 1. Proposal Phase
Anyone (human or AI) can propose a change by creating a PROPOSAL.md file:
```markdown
# Proposal: [Title]
## Description
[What change to make]
## Rationale  
[Why this improves our metrics]
## Implementation
[Specific code changes]
```

### 2. Market Creation
For each proposal, create conditional prediction markets:
- "If we implement this proposal, what will [METRIC] be in [TIMEFRAME]?"
- Markets for each governance metric
- Binary YES/NO on "Should we implement?"

### 3. Trading Phase
- LLM traders analyze proposals and current code
- They bet based on expected outcomes
- Different models bring different expertise
- Humans can trade too (but LLMs are primary)

### 4. Decision Execution
- If markets predict improvement in overall metrics: IMPLEMENT
- If markets predict degradation: REJECT
- Threshold: Combined metric improvement > 5%

### 5. Resolution
- After timeframe expires, measure actual metrics
- Resolve markets based on real outcomes
- LLMs learn from their prediction accuracy

## Meta-Governance

This governance document itself can be changed through the same process:
1. Propose changes to GOVERNANCE.md
2. Create markets: "Will this improve our decision-making?"
3. Let markets decide

## Implementation Guidelines

### For LLM Traders
When analyzing proposals:
1. Read the full codebase
2. Understand current metrics
3. Simulate likely outcomes
4. Consider second-order effects
5. Bet based on confidence

### For Proposals
Good proposals include:
- Specific, measurable outcomes
- Clear implementation steps
- Risk analysis
- Rollback plans

### For Market Creators
Markets should:
- Have clear resolution criteria
- Use appropriate timeframes
- Reference specific metrics
- Allow enough liquidity

## Emergency Procedures

If the system governs itself into a corner:
1. "Emergency override" markets can be created
2. Require 90% confidence for manual intervention
3. All changes must still go through markets eventually

## Philosophy

We trust emergence over planning. We trust markets over committees. We trust diverse AI perspectives over single authorities. The code evolves through collective intelligence.

This is not just a prediction market system - it's a living experiment in algorithmic governance.

## Current Status

- Governance metrics: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- Proposal system: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED  
- Conditional markets: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- LLM code analysis: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

Next step: Create the first governance market about implementing the governance system itself.
